        ary has been a neighbor of Ash Ketchum since they were both young. At one time, they seemed to be friends and
        went to see movies together, as seen in Lights, Camerupt, Action!.

        Shortly before beginning their journeys, Gary and Ash found an old Poké Ball while fishing. The two boys began
        fighting over who would get to keep the Poké Ball but ended up breaking it in half. Since then, they decided to
        keep the two separate pieces for themselves. It was revealed in The Ties That Bind that they still carried the
        pieces with them.
